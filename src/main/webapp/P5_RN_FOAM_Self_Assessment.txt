Self Assessment
Coding -
I first planned out how I was going to implement the grid and the marks. Then I decided how turns would be decided.
Then I implemented the grid, marks, and turns in a Game class. I then noted functionalities that the game would need and made place holder
methods that were later implemented.

Testing - 
I made a JUnit test initially to see if I was able to place a mark in a non valid space. After I confirmed that you could not place the mark
I implemented the user Interface.

User interface design - 
I followed the design in the p5 document pretty closely, only changing things slightly. I used css to style the spaces and buttons to look
the same. I also made a display to show the score of both dark and light marks. The game also has a quit button that would reset the marks.

Overall - 
The code turned out functional. However, when implementing the code I stuck with my initial implementation which uses an array.
This meant that I had to do a bunch of computations to figure out placements. This process wasnt too bad since it was just an 8 x 8. I think
overall I think my submission meets the requirements.
